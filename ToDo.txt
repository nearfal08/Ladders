Ladders TODO
--------------------
- Store rankings. May overwrite them everytime. Need to pull rankings, delete them, then insert new ones, using old rankings to calculate movement.
    Have seperate table storing a list of the final rankings for each day. Save these off at midnight every night.
- Website pulls from db instead of api.
- Add alert boxes when refreshing list on bottom right to notify user movement on the ladder.
    - In the alert box, make the player name clickable. On click, scroll to the persons position on the ladder.
- Create home page with option to select various games for their ladders.
- Style page
- Add additional stats, like win/loss etc... to players.
- Add icons on the list like up and down arrows for recent movement.
- Add animation on the list of a player moving (maybe)
